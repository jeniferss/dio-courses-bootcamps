      <h1>Welcome to the Solar System!</h1>
      <p>
        Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky
        Way galaxy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything
        bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
        Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto,
        dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids.
        Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary
        systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.

        Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we
        know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.
        While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system,
        it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the
        surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest
        of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock
        and metal.
        The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except
        for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However,
        the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”

        Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.
        The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth
        a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its
        axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides,
        creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years.
        The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.
        Earth's Moon is the fifth largest of the 190+ moons orbiting
        planets in our solar system.
        Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because
        people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered
        four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.
        NASA currently has three robotic spacecraft exploring the
        Moon — Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the twin ARTEMIS spacecraft
        (not to be confused with NASA's new Artemis program to send astronauts
        back to the Moon).

      <p>
        The sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our
        solar system. Its influence extends far beyond the orbits of distant
        Neptune and Pluto. Without the sun's intense energy and heat, there
        would be no life on Earth. And though it is special to us, there are
        billions of stars like our sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.
        If the sun were as tall as a typical front door, the Earth would be the
        size of a U.S. nickel. The temperature at the sun's core is about 27
        million degrees Fahrenheit.
